# Pashua: Native macOS dialogs for scripting languages

Pashua is a tool for creating native Aqua dialog windows from programming languages that have none or only limited support for graphic user interfaces on Mac OS X, such as AppleScript, Bash scripts, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl and others â€”and if your favourite language is not yet supported: writing the glue code for communicating with Pashua is pretty simple.

For the moment, this repository is only a **placeholder** while the source code is getting some polish, as **Pashua will be released as Open Source in April 2018**.
